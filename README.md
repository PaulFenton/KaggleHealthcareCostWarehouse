# Repo for the healthcare cost Data Warehouse codebase

Nothing here yet.. just project structure

The source data file is not versioned, get it from Kaggle or the Google shared drive and put it in a folder called "source_data"

The path should be ./source_data/Hospital_Inpatient_Discharges__SPARCS_De-Identified___2015.csv
